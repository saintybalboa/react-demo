# Routing

Routing is taken care of both server-side using reacts [StaticRouter](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/StaticRouter) and client-side (using reacts [BrowserRouter](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/BrowserRouter).

React Router exports the `matchPath` static function that it uses internally to match locations to routes. This function is used on the server to help determine what your data dependencies will be before rendering.
